This application is a user CRUD application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete their data using a web interface. The front-end of the application is built with Angular, a popular framework for developing single-page applications. The application uses Angular Material, a UI component library that implements the Material Design specifications, to create a consistent and responsive user interface. The back-end of the application is built with Spring Boot, a framework that simplifies the development of Java-based web applications. The application uses PostgreSQL, a powerful and open-source relational database system, to store and manage the user data. The application communicates with the back-end using RESTful APIs and JSON data format.
